# ðŸ§± VPC 3-Tier Architecture Setup - Step-by-Step
- This setup is done on AWS to host applications securely and efficiently by separating the system into three parts: Web, App, and Database.

# 1. Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- What it does:
- It creates your own isolated network inside AWS to launch resources (like servers) securely.

# 2. Create Subnets
- Public Subnet: Used for internet-facing components (like web servers).
- Private Subnet: Used for backend components (like app servers and database).
- What it does:
- Subnets divide the VPC into smaller sections. Public ones can talk to the internet, private ones canâ€™t unless you give them special access.

# 3. Create an Internet Gateway
- What it does:
- Allows resources in the public subnet (like web servers) to connect to the internet.

# 4. Attach Internet Gateway to VPC
- What it does:
- Connects your VPC to the internet through the gateway so traffic can flow in and out.

# 5. Create a Route Table for the Public Subnet
- What it does:
- This table tells the public subnet how to reach the internet using the Internet Gateway.

# 6. Associate the Public Subnet with the Route Table
- What it does:
- Makes sure the public subnet actually uses the route to reach the internet.

# Web Server Setup
- Steps:
- Launch EC2 in public subnet with auto-assign public IP.
- Create security group allowing:
- SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443).
- Install Apache (or Nginx):
- sudo yum update -y
- sudo yum install httpd -y
- sudo systemctl start httpd
- Access site using public IP in browser.

# 9. Create a NAT Gateway in Public Subnet
- What it does:
- Lets the private subnet connect to the internet for updates/downloads but blocks external traffic from directly accessing it.

# 10. Update Route Table for Private Subnet
- What it does:
- Routes traffic from private subnet to the internet using the NAT Gateway instead of the Internet Gateway.

# Appserver setup
# Steps
- Launch EC2 in private subnet, no public IP.
- Create security group to allow:
- SSH only from Web Server.
- SSH into it via Web Server (jump host).

# db-server setup
# 13. Launch RDS (Database) in Another Private Subnet
- What it does:
- Creates a managed database thatâ€™s secure and only accessible from the app server.

# 14. Create Security Group for Database
- What it does:
- Ensures only the app server can connect to the database (e.g., allow traffic on port 3306 for MySQL).

# 15. Test Connectivity Between Tiers
- What it does:
Checks that:

- Web server can be accessed from the internet. ![Screenshot 2025-05-01 191952](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe815ccb-e263-4eb6-b105-1c218275aac0)
- Web server can talk to app server.            ![Screenshot 2025-05-01 231559](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c033f2b-e0bb-40ef-81f8-7ec63403f1b7)
- App server can talk to database.              ![Screenshot 2025-05-01 231625](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce54781c-0035-4a95-b653-1d5179ae5007)
